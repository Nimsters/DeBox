\FIX{\subsubsection{Problem statement}
    {\bf formal $\ra$ natural language
    $\ra$ formal} is the identity function at the level of abstract syntax,
    and {\bf natural language $\ra$ formal $\ra$ natural language} is the
    identity function modulo lexical aspects such as whitespace and
    punctuation.}
 This project \chk{concerns} the design and development of a teaching tool
 to be used in the course `Logic in Computer Science' (\course) at the 
 University of Copenhagen. The tool is to be used in the teaching of
 natural deduction in \emph{propositional} logic, and allows users to
 write their proofs in English rather than the formal notation presented
 in the course textbook \book \cite{hr}.

Presenting students with a tool for writing natural deduction proofs
    in natural language is hoped to bridge the potential gap between
    understanding the structure and rules of natural deduction, and
    understanding the \emph{meaning} of the steps in such a process.
Furthermore, it is hoped that the
    presentation of such proofs in natural language will emphasize the
    \emph{independence} of the reached conclusion from the semantic 
    content of atomic declarative sentences: given \(p\) and \( p \ra q\),
    we may \emph{always} conclude \(q\)
    regardless of what declarative sentences $p$ and $q$
    represent. 
    Finally, we believe that providing concrete and detailed 
    feedback through this \chk{validation tool (\tool)} will not only
    help students learn from their mistakes, but also lower the risk of
    students getting stuck when working on their own, as well as lessen
    the work load of the TAs by catching many of the \chk{simpler}
    mistakes and thus allowing TAs to focus on students' understanding of
    the material rather than correcting \chk{typos}.

% Reader expectations
We expect readers to be familiar with \chk{\sml , as well as} the standard
 notation and terminology
 concerning the subjects \emph{parsing}, \emph{context-free grammars},
 and \emph{propositional logic} -- including Fitch-style notation
 for proofs. However, some of the specific
 tools used \chk{in} this project are briefly described below.


\subsubsection{Tools and programming language}
The \chk{development} part of the project is primarily written in the
 functional programming language \sml , using the \mos\
 \chk{implementation}. \chk{For readers unfamiliar with the module structure
 of \mos , functionality is implemented in \f{structures} stored in \f{.sml}
 files (a unit),
 and interfaces are implemented in \f{signatures} stored in \f{.sig}
 files\footnote{Or generated automatically, if no \f{.sig} file is
 provided.}.}
\paragraph{\yac} is ``a simple parser generator''\cite[p.~44]{mosman}
 that \chk{ships with} \mos .
 Given a context-free grammar specification with attached semantic actions,
 \yac\ produces a \f{.sml} file containing a \mos\ unit with code for
 a parser and a \f{.sig} file containing its interface
 \cite[\chk{\emph{ibid.}}]{mosman}.

\paragraph{\lex} is a lexer generator that \chk{ships with} \mos . It 
 \chk{takes} a set of regular expressions with attached semantic actions,
 and produces a \f{.sml} file containin \mos\ code for a lexical
 analyser\cite[p.~40]{mosman}. ``When used in conjunction with a parser
 generated by [\yac], the semantic actions compute a value belonging to
 the datatype \f{token} defined by the generated parsing 
 unit''\cite[\emph{ibid.}]{mosman}.

\paragraph{\bp} The \bp\ help-page\cite{boxhelp} gives the following
 description:
\begin{quote}
BoxProver is a userfriendly front-end to the Twelf\footnote{From
 the \s{Twelf} website\cite{twelf}: ``Twelf provides a uniform meta-language
 for specifying, implementing, and proving properties of programming
 languages and logics.''}proof assistant, and
 provides a simple way to encode and verify natural deduction proofs in
 propositional and first-order logic using Fitch-style notation. [...] 
 Besides verification, BoxProver also has facilities for producing visual
 representations of proofs, closely following the style and notation of
 the book \book, 2nd edition by Huth \& Ryan.
\end{quote}
Since this project \chk{deals with} \emph{propositional} logic, we do not
 concern ourselves with the \bp\ \chk{syntax} for first-order logic. 
 Thus, when we use the term `\bp\ syntax' in the following, it \chk{refers}
 to a subset that \chk{defines} natural deduction proofs in propositional
 logic, rather than the full syntax of \bp.

To illustrate the functionality of \bp , \fig{boxnfitch} shows an example
 of a Fitch-style proof (\subref{sf:fs}) and its encoding in \bp\ 
 (\subref{sf:boxin}) side by side; the visual representation provided by
 \bp\ is alsmost identical to the one shown in (\subref{sf:fs}).
