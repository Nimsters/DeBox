Because of the desire to give feedback, the surface syntax for proofs in
natural language was designed to be inclusive and allow for errors rather
than restrict acceptable proofs to correct ones. This idea of inclusion
also extends to the syntax for the formulae.

\sss{Inclusive grammar for formulae}
The \chk{chosen} syntax for formulae is a close match to the equivalent
 \bp\ syntax, and but for one change \ours\ would simply be an extention
 of it. As shown in \fig{nlform}, \abs\ is no longer \chk{signified} by
 \f{bot}, as is the case in the \bp\ syntax, but rather by both a sequence 
 of regular characters (\verb+_|_+) and a special character (\(\bot\)). 
 The same goes for the operators, except for implication which has an
 additional regular character signifier, to allow for individual preferences
 in typing implication arrows. Having multiple signifiers for each
 operator, and \chk{the \abs\ formula}, ensures that the grammar
 accepts both typed and pretty-printed formulae. Furthermore, having a
 non-terminal for each of the aforementioned \chk{elements} makes it
 very simple to extend the grammar with more signifiers later on, or change
 the existing ones, without having to change the 
 \chk{structure of the grammar}.

\sss{Design decisions: logical operators and linguistic ambiguity}
When formulating a grammar for logical formulae in natural language, it
 might seem like an obvious choice to use the \chk{linguistic counterparts}
 for the \chk{mathematical} terms
 (\emph{and}, \emph{or}, \emph{not}, \emph{if ... then},  and \emph{\abs})
 as signifiers instead of the \chk{symbol} representation used. However, 
 the English language, \chk{like most - if not all - natural languages}, is
 ambiguous. While a statement like:
 \begin{quote}
    The dog barks \emph{and} the cat meows.
 \end{quote}
 seems unambiguous, the same is not the case for the following:
 \begin{quote}
    The dog barks \emph{or} the cat meows.
 \end{quote}
 Is the \emph{or} to be interpreted as inclusive or exclusive? 
 The intuition for most will be exclusive, but the logical disjunction
 operator is inclusive. And what about more complex composite formulae,
 and the negation of those? 
 
 As it turns out, not even the simple conjunction can be considered 
 unambiguous; in a study\cite{negation} of the understanding and
 formulation of compound assertions (conjunctions, disjunctions, 
 conditionals, and negations of these) in English, only 86\% of the
 participants interpreted the conjunctions \chk{in accordance with the
 standards of propositional logic}\cite[p.~4]{negation}. The study also
 showed that the interpretation of disjunctions as either
 inclusive or exclusive varied, with only 9\% of participants \chk{seeing}
 them as inclusive, against 59\% exclusive\cite[\emph{ibid.}]{negation}.
 Furthermore, this bias towards an exclusive interpretation was completely
 reversed in the case of negated disjunctions where 86\% gave an inclusive
 interpretation:
 \begin{quote}
 The compound, \emph{A or B},
 was treated as exclusive [...] rather than inclusive [...]
 in affirmations, but as inclusive [...] rather than exclusive [...] 
 in negations. The compound, \emph{If A then B}, was
 often treated as a biconditional [...] in affirmations, but
 never in negations.\cite[p.~5]{negation}
 \end{quote}
 Since interpretation not only varies between individuals but also 
 depends on context, simply defining e.g. disjunctions as one or the other
 will result in enforcing a counterintuitive interpretation in many cases,
 regardless of which interpretation is picked.
 
 On top of that, standard English, while allowing for
 complex sentences using subordinate clauses, does not lend itself well to
 compound contructions nested to arbitrary depth. Although there is no 
 inherent precedence distinction between conjunctions and disjunctions, it
 \emph{is} possible to guide \chk{the proper interpretation} by using 
 subordinators of different length:
 \begin{quote}
 \ttfamily
    p \emph{and} q \emph{or else} r \hfill (p \(\land\) q) \(\lor\) r~ \\
    p \emph{and also} q \emph{or} r\hfill p \(\land\) (q \(\lor\) r)
 \end{quote}
 This solution, however, does not work for arbitratily deep nestings, nor
 does it solve the inclusive/exclusive problem for disjunctions.

 Rather than introduce a complex new set of rules to narrow (and possibly
 counter) intuitive understanding of conjunctions, disjunctions,
 conditionals, and the negations of these, the syntax uses
 \chk{symbolic} notation, for which there already exists a set standard
 for unambiguous interpretation and which is an inherent part of
 propositional logic and thus necessarily on the syllabus of the course.

\sss{Inclusive grammar for proofs}
While the grammar for formulae is based closely on the equivalent \bp\
 surface syntax, the grammar for proofs is a much closer match to the
 abstract syntax for proofs. The \chk{definition} is shown in \fig{nlproof}
 and will accept almost any \chk{combination of elements} representable
 by the abstract \f{proofstep}. One exception is the distinction between
 discharges and all other steps; \f{DISCHARGE} is the only non-terminal
 that allows the acceptance of a step without a formula, and \f{DIS} is
 \emph{not} included in the set of rules that can be used in acceptable
 steps \emph{with} a formula. Furthermore, \f{DISCHARGE} steps are the only
 steps, \chk{except for the very last one,} that are accepted without a step
 ID, and they are \emph{only} accepted without one. 
 
 Structurally, all non-discharge steps are composed of an \f{ARGUMENT} and
 a \f{CONCLUSION} A non-terminal exists for every \f{rule} in the abstract syntax.

 In terms of English grammar, the proof syntax accepts lists both with and
 without Oxford comma\footnote{Also known as the serial comma; the term
 denotes the comma before the \chk{connective} in a list. 
 With Oxford comma: `propositions, formulae, and proofs'. 
 Without: `propositions, formulae and proofs'.},
 but ensures the use of obligatory comma after an \chk{adverbial phrase}
 when it precedes the main clause.
