\ss{Parser}
The grammar described in ``\nameref{nlgram}'' is implemented as a parser
 definition, \f{Parser.grm}. The full code can be found in \app{Parser}
 and was used to \chk{autogenerate} a parser for natural deduction proofs
 written in natural language. It was generated with the tool \s{MosML}-yacc,
 using the abstract syntax implemented in \f{\nameref{Proof}}
 (see \app{Proof}). Like the abstract syntax, the parser definition is
 written in \chk{\s{Standard ML}}\FIX{Add something here}.
 As seen in \lst{../Parser.grm125}, tokens are defined to
 represent all terminals of the grammar for proofs in natural language,
 and all non-terminals are named; precedence levels and
 associativity is specified for the logical operators; all tokens and
 non-terminals are assigned a type using the datatype and type definitions
 from \f{Proof.sml}, and a start symbol for the grammar is specified
 \chk{(l. 13)}.
 \codepart{../Parser.grm}{\FIX{caption}}{1}{25}
 Following this, the structure of the grammar is defined by specifying all
 productions in the grammar.

\ss{Lexer}
The lexer was generated from the lexer definition found in \app{Lexer}.
