The grammar for NL formulas so far:
\begin{quote}
\ttfamily
PROPOSITION $\ra$ IMPLICATION | PROP\\
IMPLICATION $\ra$ \txt{if } PROP \txt{ is provable then so is } PROP\\
\(~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\) |
\txt{if } PROP \txt{ is provable then so is the proposition that } IMP'\\
IMP' \(~~~~~~~\)$\ra$ IMPLICATION | IMP \\
PROP \(~~~~~~~\)$\ra$ SIMPLE | LIST \\
LIST \(~~~~~~~\)$\ra$ PAIR\txt{, } PAIR\txt{, and also } PAIR |
                      PAIR\txt{, } PAIR\txt{, or else } PAIR\\
\(~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\) | PAIR\txt{, } LIST\\
SIMPLE \(~~~~~\)$\ra$ PAIR \txt{ and also } PAIR |
                      PAIR \txt{ or else } PAIR  | PAIR\\
PAIR \(~~~~~~~\)$\ra$ SINGLE \txt{ and }  SINGLE | SINGLE \txt{ or } SINGLE
                    | SINGLE | IMP\\
IMP \(~~~~~~~~\)$\ra$ SINGLE \txt{ implies } SINGLE
                    | SINGLE \txt{ does not imply } SINGLE\\
SINGLE \(~~~~~\)$\ra$ \txt{the statement ``}PROPOSITION\txt{''} |
                      \txt{the negation of ``}PROPOSITION\txt{''}\\
\(~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\) | NEGATION | {\bf atom}\\
NEGATION \(~~~\)$\ra$ \txt{not-}NEGATION | \txt{not-}{\bf atom}\\
\end{quote}

\sss{Quotation marks}
If the grammar is to account for correctly alternating quotation marks,
then everything will have to be repeated and the two grammar "sets" should
only cross in the \f{formula} and \f{negation} constructions:
\begin{quote}
\ttfamily
PROPOSITION $\ra$ IMPLICATION | PROP\\
$\vdots$\\
SINGLE \(~~~~~\)$\ra$ \txt{the statement ``}*PROPOSITION\txt{''} |
                      \txt{the negation of ``}*PROPOSITION\txt{''}\\
\(~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\) | NEGATION | {\bf atom}\\
NEGATION \(~~~\)$\ra$ \txt{not-}NEGATION | \txt{not-}{\bf atom}\\
~\\
*PROPOSITION $\ra$ IMPLICATION | PROP\\
$\vdots$\\
*SINGLE \(~~~~~\)$\ra$ \txt{the statement `}PROPOSITION\txt{'} |
                      \txt{the negation of `}PROPOSITION\txt{'}\\
\(~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\) | NEGATION | {\bf atom}\\
\end{quote}

\sss{Linguistic negation}
The linguistic negations of pairs:
\begin{quote}
not both p and q are valid\\
neither p nor q is valid\\
\end{quote}
does not read properly when used within a longer formula:
\begin{quote}
    not both p and q are valid and also r\\
    p and also neither q nor r is valid\\
\end{quote}
Instead, these formulas should read:
\begin{quote}
    not both p and q are valid but r is\\
    p is valid but neither q nor r is
\end{quote}
To account for this, one would have to make the grammar a lot more complex
with special cases for \f{and also}, \f{or else} and \f{implication} for 
every possible combination of negated and non-negated sub-propositions.

Linguistic negation of lists and \f{and also}/\f{or else} constructions
seem difficult to do without introducing ambiguity.
Must research further on linguistic negation to determine how exactly to 
handle these cases.

\ss{April 8th}
Some changes still need to be done on the grammar.
\begin{itemize}
    \item For \s{implication}: to ensure the distinction between the two
    types, a \s{prop} should no longer convert to \s{imp}.

    \item For \s{simple}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Not both first and second child should be \s{single}
            \item For first child: \s{imp} should not be a possibily unless
            in brackets (when read, it itroduces ambiguity despite the
            distance created by `and also' and `or else').

            \item For second child: unbracketed \s{implication} should be a
            possibility.
        \end{itemize}

    \item For bracketing: only complex statements should be bracketed.

    \item For negation statements: atom- and not-negations should never be
    negated using statements

\end{itemize}

The new grammar looks as follows:

\begin{quote}
\ttfamily
PROPOSITION $\ra$ COMPLEX | PAIR | NEGATION | UNIT\\
PROP \(~~~~~~~\)$\ra$ LIST | MULTI | PAIR\\
PROP' \(~~~~~~\)$\ra$ LIST | MULTI | PAIR | SINGLE\\
PROP* \(~~~~~~\)$\ra$ COMPLEX | PAIR | NEGATION\\
COMPLEX \(~~~~\)$\ra$ IMPLICATION | LIST | MULTI\\
IMPLICATION $\ra$ SINGLE \txt{ implies } SINGLE
                    | SINGLE \txt{ implies that } IMPLICATION\\
\(~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\) |
\txt{if } PROP\txt{ is provable then so is } PROP'\\
\(~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\) |
\txt{if } PROP' \txt{ is provable then so is } PROP\\
\(~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\) |
\txt{if } PROP \txt{ is provable then so is the proposition that } 
IMPLICATION\\
LIST \(~~~~~~~\)$\ra$ ELEMENT\txt{, } ELEMENT\txt{, and also } ELEMENT |
                      ELEMENT\txt{, } ELEMENT\txt{, or else } ELEMENT\\
\(~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\) | ELEMENT\txt{, } LIST\\
MULTI \(~~~~~~\)$\ra$ PAIR \:\txt{ and also } ELEMENT |
                      SINGLE \txt{ and also } ELEMENT' |\\
\(~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\) | PAIR \txt{ or else } ELEMENT  |
                      SINGLE \txt{ or else } ELEMENT'\\
ELEMENT \(~~~~\)$\ra$ PAIR | IMPLICATION | SINGLE\\
ELEMENT' \(~~~\)$\ra$ PAIR | IMPLICATION\\
PAIR \(~~~~~~~\)$\ra$ SINGLE \txt{ and }  SINGLE | SINGLE \txt{ or } SINGLE\\
SINGLE \(~~~~~\)$\ra$ STAT | UNIT | NEGATION\\
STAT \(~~~~~~~\)$\ra$ \txt{the statement ``}COMPLEX\txt{''}\\
NEGATION \(~~~\)$\ra$ \txt{the negation of ``}PROP*\txt{''}\\
NEG \(~~~~~~~~\)$\ra$ \txt{not-}UNIT\\
UNIT \(~~~~~~~\)$\ra$ NEG | {\bf atom}\\
\end{quote}
Question: Should \s{implication} remain as possible \s{element}? Does the 
Oxford comma remove the ambiguity?

\ss{April 10th}
Discovered several errors while implementing NL grammar:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \f{NEG} is superflous: \f{UNIT} = not-\f{UNIT} | {\bf atom}
    \item The grammar accepts both:
        \begin{quote}\f{SINGLE} and \f{IMPLICATION}\\
                     \f{SINGLE} and the statement \f{IMPLICATION}
        \end{quote}
        The same goes for or.
    \item Any list must either always start with a pair of the same type or
    never start with a pair of the same type. This should be reflected in 
    the grammar.
\end{itemize}
Further question: should \f{PAIR} be replaced Lists with only two elements
and thus be written "p, and also q or r"/ "p or q, and also r"?

\ss{April 11th}
Discovered another error: "if \f{PROP'} is provable then so is \f{PROP}"
should be "if \f{SINGLE} is provable then so is \f{PROP}. This means that
\f{PROP'} can be restructured to \f{PROP} | \f{SINGLE}.

\sss{Solution to structure of lists?}
If we extend the type of elements with:
\begin{quote}
    \f{EXT } $\ra$ \f{ELEMENT} | \f{EXT}, \f{ELEMENT}
\end{quote}
Then \f{LIST} could be reduced to:
\begin{quote}
    \f{LIST} $\ra$ \f{EXT}, and also \f{ELEMENT} 
                 | \f{EXT}, or else  \f{ELEMENT}
\end{quote}
(presuming we also replace \f{MULTI} with two-element lists. A similar
structure for triples could easily be constructed, but requires \f{EXT} to
be split up further).

This would preserve the structure of the nested \f{AND}s, and I think it
would be a lot easier to work with when parsing NL to symbolic.
