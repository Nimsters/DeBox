\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Problem statement}
    Is it possible to develop a tool for writing natural deduction proofs
    in a subset of the English language that will read as natural language
    (from here on, this subset will just be named `natural language'),
    and have these proofs validated? Additionally, is it feasible to have
    a round-tripping ability such that {\bf formal $\ra$ natural language
    $\ra$ formal} is the identity function at the level of abstract syntax,
    and {\bf natural language $\ra$ formal $\ra$ natural language} is the
    identity function modulo lexical aspects such as whitespace and
    punctuation.

\subsection{Scope}
    This project will limit itself to natural deduction proofs of
    \emph{propositional} logic, and the validation is expected to be done
    using the existing tool \s{BoxProver}\cite{box}. Furthermore, the tool
    to be developed is specifically intended for use in the course `Logic
    in computer science' at the University of Copenhagen, and for  
    pedagogical reasons, the atoms used in the natural language syntax
    will be characters rather than specified declarative sentences.

\subsection{Motivation}
    The course `Logic in computer science' rather closely follows the 
    structure outlined in the textbook `Logic in computer science' by
    Huth \& Ryan\cite{hr}. The introduction to formal logic is based on
    reasoning about construction of (valid) arguments in natural 
    language\cite[pp.~1-2]{hr}, which forms the basis for the presentation
    of a formal notation using the symbols 
    \(\neg, \lor, \land, \txt{ and } \ra\)\cite[p.~4]{hr}. 
    The \emph{meaning} of these symbols is presented in natural language,
    but with the exception of a few simple examples, the rest of the section 
    on propositional logic, including the rules for natural deduction,
    is presented solely in formal (i.e. symbol) notation.

    Presenting students with a tool for writing natural deduction proofs
    in natural language is hoped to bridge the potential gap between
    understanding the structure and rules of natural deduction and
    understanding the \emph{meaning} of the steps in such a process as well
    as the conclusion reached. Furthermore, it is hoped the the
    presentation of such proofs in natural language will emphasize the
    \emph{independence} of the reached conclusion from the semantic 
    content of atomic declarative sentences; \(p, p \ra q \vdash q\)
    regardless
    of what declarative sentences one may choose $p$ and $q$ to represent.
