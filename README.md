    - [x] Datatype definitions 
    - [ ] Implementation of conversion to BoxProver syntax
    - [ ] Implementation of validation
        - [ ] Validity checks for steps
            - [ ] Rule reference requirement matches given number of references
            - [ ] References exist
            - [ ] Rule pattern requirement matches the referenced formula(e)
            - [ ] References are acessible (i.e. not in a closed box)
            - [ ] The reference id given to the step is unique
        - [ ] Validity checks for proof
            - [ ] All assumption discharged
            - [ ] The conclusion of the last line is identical to the goal
        - [ ] Error feedback for all failed checks
