        - [x] Validity checks for steps
            - [x] Given references match basic pattern
            - [x] References exist
            - [x] Rule pattern requirement matches the referenced formula(e)
            - [x] References are acessible (i.e. not in a closed box)
            - [x] The reference id given to the step is unique
        - [x] Validity checks for proof
            - [x] All assumption discharged
            - [x] The conclusion of the last line is identical to the goal
        - [x] Error feedback for all failed checks
    - [ ] Implementation of output
        - [ ] Ensure valid filename from title (parsing?)
        - [x] Output feedback if proof is invalid
        - [x] Output BoxProver proof if proof is valid
