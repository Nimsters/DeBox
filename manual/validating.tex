\section{Validating proofs}
To validate a proof, run the program \f{DeBox} with the relative
path to your proof file as argument:
\begin{figure}[!ht]
\ttfamily
\$ DeBox proofs/short\_example.txt
\caption{Running \f{DeBox} on the short example proof provided}
\label{ex:short}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Valid} proofs will return a \s{BoxProver} notation proof to
the standard output stream (usually the terminal). This can be piped to
a file, which can be opened directly from \s{BoxProver}.

\paragraph{Invalid} proofs, if accepted, will return a list of 
errors to the standard 
error stream (usually also the terminal). This can be piped to an error-log
file, if desired. If not accepted, either lexer or parser errors are
returned. Lexer errors should be decipherable, but the parser errors can
be more tricky. To help with those, a check-list is provided below:
