DeBox is a teaching tool for teaching propositional logic. It allows the
user to write natural deduction proofs in (pseudo) natural language, by
using a specified notation in English, rather than the
Fitch-style notation presented in the course textbook. Additionally,
DeBox provides proof validation of such natural language proofs. If valid,
the proof is returned in \s{BoxProof} notation; if invalid, feedback is
provided in the form of a concrete and detailed list of errors.

This manual provides a quick walk-through of how to formulate natural
language
proofs, and how to validate them using DeBox.
