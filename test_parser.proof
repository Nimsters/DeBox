example:
From the premise (p→q)∧(p→r), we wish to prove p→q∧r.
We have the premise (p→q)∧(p→r) [prm].
By applying the first and-elimination rule to [prm], we get p→q [piq].
By applying the second and-elimination rule to [prm], we get p→r [pir].
Assume p [p].
    By applying the implication-elimination rule to [p] and [piq], we get q [q].
    By applying the implication-elimination rule to [p] and [pir], we get r [r].
    By applying the and-introduction rule to [q] and [r], we get q∧r [qar].
Discharge assumption [p].
By applying the implication-introduction rule to [p]-[qar], we conclude p→q∧r.
